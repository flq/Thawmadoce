# Info on _The awesome markdown centrifuge_

What you write here is <u>markdown</u>. This info text is markdown. If you want to see
it rendered to HTML, press __Control + Tab__.

If you want to be helped when marking _down_ your text, just select the text in question. 
The selection toolbar will appear.

If you like working with keyboard shortcuts, make sure that you read the tooltips, most commands
should have a keyboard shortcut. The Shortcuts from the __App Menu__ will only be active when it is 
open. Thankfully there is a shortcut for that: __Control + Enter__.

When you save a document, you don't need to press save again: Thawmadoce will basically save your document 
_all the time_.
